      I will be taking your response and formatting it inside user-friendly quiz taking environment on my website. 
      Please respond in JSON format. 
      For each question, specify whether the questions is 0, 1, or 2 ---> multiple choice, true/false, short response. 
      Each question should be an object with keys: type, question, choices, answer.
